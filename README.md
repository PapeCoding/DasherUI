# DasherUI
This repository features a simple UI, written in ImGui, for the DasherCore backend. Its main purpose is the testing/development of the DasherCore library. So it is not meant for pretty looks or actual usability. 

## Cloning and Building
1. Clone the repository with all submodules: `git clone --recursive https://github.com/PapeCoding/DasherUI.git ./DasherUI`
2. Generate some project files with CMake:
  * `cd ./DasherUI && mkdir build && cd build`
  * `cmake ..`
3. Build the project with the selected build system (e.g. Visual Studio on Windows or `make` on Linux)

## Participate
If you want to modernize some code within DasherCore or add UI features to the DasherUI repository, feel free to send a pull request!
